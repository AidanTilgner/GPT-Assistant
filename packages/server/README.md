# QuasarBrains Assistant Server

A simple express server helper to get up and running with the assistant framework quickly.

## Pre-Release

**Assistant and related packages are currently pre-release!** There is some core functionality, but there's still a long way to go until it's ready to be used. No garuntee of backward's compatibility can be given at this time, as the kinks are worked out and the framework is stress tested. If you're interested in helping out, testing it pre-release, or have questions, [reach out to me](mailto:aidantilgner02@gmail.com), or leave an issue.

Check out [the roadmap](https://github.com/QuasarBrains/Assistant/blob/master/Roadmap.md) for more info.
