# QuasarBrains Assistant Framework

An infinitely extendable assistant framework to automate your life.

## Pre-Release

**Assistant is currently pre-release!** There is some core functionality, but there's still a long way to go until it's ready to be used. No garuntee of backward's compatibility can be given at this time, as the kinks are worked out and the framework is stress tested. If you're interested in helping out, or testing it pre-release, [send me an email](mailto:aidantilgner02@gmail.com), or hmu some other way for more details.

Check out [the roadmap](https://github.com/QuasarBrains/Assistant/blob/master/Roadmap.md) for more info.
